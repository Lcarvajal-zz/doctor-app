### Doctor App

# This is not an actual application for diagnosing people. Please do not diagnose yourself with it!

This is a project for my mobile programming class at FSU.

The Doctor App shows an implementation of Picker View by allowing a user to select a symptom with the picker view and then displaying suggested medications for the user to take.
